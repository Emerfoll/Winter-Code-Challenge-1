Div Generator

Clicking the "Generate" button creates a new div and increments the number displayed in the div.
Each div created starts with a red background color, a "Yellow" button, a "Delete" button, and a number equal to the number of times the "Generate" button has been clicked.

The "Yellow" button changes the background color from red to yellow.

The "Delete" button removes the div it is in along with all the other elements within the div.
